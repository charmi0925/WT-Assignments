<p> Not until 2018, did I know what I really wanted to do in my career. And on one fine day, I took up computer engineering in one of the most renowed university of Gujrat, Charotar University of Science and Technology. I am pretty confident that with pursuing this field, I will do very good in my future.</p>
<p>I was born on 25th of february in rajkot.I was brought up in Vadodara. As a child, I was very shy. But schooling brought a drastic change in me.I completed my HSC from Nand Vidya Niketan with 9.8 CGPA. I completed my HSC from Krishna International School with 90.2%.
I had also secured 54 AIR in NCO; National Creativity Olympiad.</p>
<p>I am very fond of reading novels, watching series, dancing and playing badminton. I have represented my school and district at various badminton tournaments and have won a few of them. I have done kathak training for 4 years. I love travelling and explore new places.</p>
